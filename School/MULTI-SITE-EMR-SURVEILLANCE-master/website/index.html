	<p>In 2012, a daily medication for the prevention of acquiring HIV infection (called PrEP) was approved and in 2014, CDC issued clinical practice guidelines for its use. CDC estimates that 1.2 million Americans
	have indications for its use. A clinical decision support tool is needed to assist clinicians in identifying their patients with indications for PrEP Surveillance of the provision of PrEP and associated 
	laboratory tests to appropriate patients is dependent on developing EMR-based data collection methods that will operate accross multiple sites with different EMR systems.</p>
	<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
	<p>Objective 1. using algorithms defined in the CDC guidelines develop a FHIR-based clinical support that informs clinicians which of their patients should be offered PrEP. </br>
	Objective 2. is to pull EMR data on demographics, diagnoses, lab tests, and medications for use in an algorithm that defines PrEP patients for surveillance purposes.</p>
